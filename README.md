# Python-List-Questions
1. Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]
2. Write a Python program to generate all sublists of a list.
3. Write a Python program to change the position of every n-th value with the (n+1)th in a list.
Sample list: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
Expected Output: [1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4]
4. Write a Python program to convert a list of multiple integers into a single integer.
5. Write a Python program to split a list based on first character of word.
6. Write a Python program to find missing and additional values in two lists.
Sample data : Missing values in second list: a,b,c
Additional values in second list: g,h
7. Write a Python program to split a list into different variables
8. Write a Python program to generate groups of five consecutive numbers in a list
9. Write a Python program to convert a pair of values into a sorted unique array.
10. Write a Python program to insert an element before each element of a list.
11. Write a Python program to print a nested lists (each list on a new line) using the print() function.
12. Write a Python program to convert list to list of dictionaries.
13. Write a Python program to sort a list of nested dictionaries
14. Write a Python program to split a list every Nth element.
Sample list: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']
Expected Output: [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
15. Write a Python program to create a list with infinite elements
16. Write a Python program to convert a list of type String to a list.
17. Write a Python program to iterate over two lists simultaneously.
18. Write a Python program to access dictionary keys element by index.
19. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list of lists
Sample list : [[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]
New List : [[10, 20], [30, 56, 25], [33], [40]]
